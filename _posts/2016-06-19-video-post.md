# All Things Beauty.

## How it all started...

I'm sure some people have some really interesting stories about how their love for make up started. They snuck into their mum's room and stole a red lipstick, smearing it all over their faces to be caught out with a crumbled product all over their hands, face and the hard wood floor. 

So if you're expecting that from me, you're wrong.

My love for make up started by sitting with my dad in the office room in our house. I would grab a red crayon and draw a spot on my skin, place the weird yellow crusty part of the soap on top and cover with nail varnish. Special effect make up you could say. What I had created was an oozing replica of a spot, my Dad a guinea pig who was demanded to squat it. That is my story. A love for trying to create special effect make up.
